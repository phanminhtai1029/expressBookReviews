cURL Command:
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/customer/auth/review/1 -b /tmp/cookies.txt

{"message":"Review successfully deleted"}

Verification - Only the other user's review remains:
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/review/1

Note: The delete operation only removes the review posted by the logged-in user (testuser).
Other users' reviews on the same book remain intact, demonstrating proper user isolation.
